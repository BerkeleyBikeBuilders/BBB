Hello! This is a directory for codes created for projects at the Bike Builders of Berkeley.

This project was written on the Platform IO IDE in VSCode, But, you can also access the Arduino IDE version in the telemetryINO folder (be warned its contents might be out of date).

All the .h header files are stored in ./telemetryPIO/include
